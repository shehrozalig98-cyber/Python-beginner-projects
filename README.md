Python-beginner-projects
This repository contains a collection of beginner-level Python projects that I built while practicing the fundamentals of programming.

These projects helped me strengthen core concepts such as:

Variables and data types
Loops and conditions
Functions
File handling
Basic algorithms
Projects Included
Simple Calculator
Guess the Number Game
To-Do List App
Password Generator
Basic Data Analysis Scripts
And more as I continue learning...
I will keep updating this repo as I practice new ideas and improve my skills.
